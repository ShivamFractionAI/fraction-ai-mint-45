      question: "When can I start to mint?",
      answer: "Minting is currently live for whitelisted wallets. Public sale begins January 15, 2025."
    },
    {
      question: "How many NFTs am I allowed to mint per wallet?",
      answer: "Each wallet can mint a maximum of 3 NFTs during both whitelist and public phases."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any benefits for NFT holders?",
      answer: "Yes. Holding an NFT grants you access to premium AI trading strategies, monthly FRAC token distributions, governance voting rights, exclusive community access, and priority customer support."
    },
    {
      question: "What do I get for referring others?",
      answer: "You'll receive rebate rewards for up to 3 referrals â€” $50 for the first, $100 for the second, and $150 for the third successful mint."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I claim a physical edition of my NFT?",
      answer: "Physical editions are not available for this collection. This is a digital-only NFT collection."
    },
    {
      question: "What blockchain is this NFT on?",
      answer: "The Fraction AI NFT collection is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is eligible for whitelist minting?",
      answer: "Whitelist eligibility was determined through community engagement, Discord participation, Twitter contests, and early supporter recognition. Whitelist registration has closed."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if the collection sells out?",
      answer: "Once all 5,000 NFTs are minted, no additional NFTs will be available from this collection. You can still trade them on secondary markets like OpenSea."
